# 🍕 Pizza vs No Pizza - Image Classification with CNN

## 📌 About

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images as **pizza** or **not pizza**. It applies basic image augmentation techniques to improve generalization and prevent overfitting. This is an ideal beginner-friendly computer vision project.
